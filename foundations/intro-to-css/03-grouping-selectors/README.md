# Grouping Selectors

Let's build a little off the previous exercise. Here, you're going to give two elements each a unique class name, then add rules for styles that both elements share as well as their own unique styles. Make sure you take a good look at the outcome image below to see exactly what is unique about each element, and what both elements have in common.

This will help you further practice adding classes and using class selectors, so be sure you add the class attribute in the HTML file. For the remainder of these exercises, the format of any colors is entirely up to you; we trust you'll practice using the different values! The properties you need to add to each element are:

- **The first element**: a black background and white text
- **The second element**: a yellow background
- **Both elements**: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing `Helvetica` and `Times New Roman`, with `sans-serif` as a fallback

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check

- Does each element have a unique class name?
- Answer: Yes
- Did you use the grouping selector for styles that both elements share?
- Answer: Yes
- Did you make separate rules for the styles unique to each element?
- Answer: Yes
- Self Marking Status: I got the desired output but naming convention of classes can be improved like more meaningful also I feel like there is a difference between how the selectors are placed like group selectors are on top in solution.css and unique selectors are below for now I don't now if it matters or not but maybe there can be a good reason behind it so making a change in styles.css by moving group selectors on top of the file"
- Note: I asked ChatGPT for where you should place group selectors in CSS file, I shouldn't have asked though ChatGPT use is not allowed in TOP, but it was for just knowing the best practices like bit more advanced kind of thing idk for me it is clean code does matter, so the answer to it is they must be placed logically like place them near related rules.
